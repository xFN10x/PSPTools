Various tools for managing your PlaystationÂ®  Portable, with support for PS3

Features include:

- **Save Manager** - View normal and possibly corrupted saves.
- **Save Importer/Downloader** -  Import saves from zip and folder. Download saves from a [Save Database](https://github.com/bucanero/apollo-saves), or a URL.
- **Save Patcher** - Patch save files for PSP, (and ps3!) with Apollo Save Tool.
- **Game Manager/Adder** (Planned: 1.2) - Add games/ISOs/homebrew from a URL, or zip. No need for manual extracting.
- **AutoPSX (PS1 EBOOT Creator)** (Planned: 1.3) - Create PS1 EBOOTS from BIN/CUE, m3u, zip, 7z and more, without the need of anything else.

### Using JAR
If you don't have a prebuilt version of PSPTools made for your platform, you can use the cross-platform jar. You need to follow these steps to make sure it works properly.

#### Install JRE
A JRE is required to run the jar. You may already have one installed, but if the program doesn't start, use [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-21) (You should also run `java -jar "path/of/PSPTools.jar"`, and make an issue with the error.)
